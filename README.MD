## Introduction

GLSL is a powerful language that allows developers to write shaders for rendering graphics in real-time applications. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide and resources for studying GLSL.

## Getting Started

To get started with GLSL, you will need a basic understanding of computer graphics and programming concepts. Familiarity with OpenGL or WebGL is also beneficial. Follow the steps below to start your GLSL study journey:

1. Install a GLSL development environment, such as [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/), [GLSL Sandbox](http://glslsandbox.com/), or [Shaderific](https://www.shaderific.com/).
2. Explore the GLSL syntax and language features.
3. Experiment with simple shaders and gradually increase the complexity.
4. Study different shader types, including vertex shaders, fragment shaders, and geometry shaders.
5. Dive into advanced topics like lighting, texturing, and post-processing effects.

## Examples

This repository provides a collection of GLSL examples to help you understand various shader techniques. Feel free to explore the [examples](examples) directory and experiment with the code.

## Resources

Here are some recommended resources to enhance your GLSL study:

- [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) - A gentle introduction to GLSL shaders.
- [OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) Reference](<https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Core_Language_(GLSL)>) - Official documentation for GLSL.
- [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/) - A comprehensive guide to WebGL programming.
